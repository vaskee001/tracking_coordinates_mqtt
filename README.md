# tracking_coordinates_mqtt
Title: MQTT Location Tracker

Description:

This repository contains an application designed to track coordinates via MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and visualize them on a map interface. The application comprises a backend and frontend component that work collaboratively to accomplish this task.

Features:

    MQTT Integration: Utilizes MQTT protocol for receiving coordinates data.
    Backend Processing: The backend component processes incoming coordinates and facilitates communication with the frontend.
    Frontend Visualization: Renders the coordinates on a map interface, providing a visual representation of the tracked locations.
    Real-time Updates: Supports real-time updates of coordinates, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is displayed.
    Simple Interface: User-friendly interface for easy interaction and understanding.

How it Works:

    The application connects to an MQTT broker to receive coordinates data.
    The backend component receives the coordinates from the MQTT broker and processes them.
    Processed coordinates are sent to the frontend for visualization.
    The frontend component displays the coordinates on a map interface, indicating the location with a dot.

Usage:

To use this application, follow these steps:

    Set up an MQTT broker and configure the application to connect to it.
    Run the backend component to receive and process coordinates.
    Run the frontend component to visualize the coordinates on the map interface.
